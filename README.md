# EDA_TSNE_On_-DonorsChoose
Exploratory Data Analysis and apply TSNE On DonorsChoose data set features:

pipeline of EDA: 1. Reading Data,

                 2. Data Analysis(Univariate Analysis for each feature and ploting with summary ),
                 
                 3. Text preprocessing - Text Data,
                 
                 4.Preparing data models - Vectorizing categorical data(one hot encoding),
                 
                 5.Vectorizing Text data ( Bag of words, TFIDF, avg W2v, TFIDF weighted W2V ),
                 
                 6.Vectorizing Numerical features ( StandardScaler ),
                 
                 7.Merging all the above features (Categorical + Text + numarical ) - using hstck method,
                 
                 8. Apply TSNE,
                 
                 9. Overall Summary.
                 
Thank you.
